# What Helix does

Status as of 2026-11-01. Helix was **restarted from scratch with its own architecture.** Players can
join, spawn in a BDS world, see each other, use their inventory, and break and place blocks. Everything follows BDS 1.26.60.

## What works

- **Networking:** NetherNet and RakNet, and the login the way BDS 1.26.60 does it (Xbox Live
  checks, encryption, resource packs).
- **Worlds:** the world folder (`worlds/Bedrock level`, BDS's layout) opens at boot through the
  `world` library's stores. Players spawn at the level.dat spawn, or where a BDS world saved them.
  Flat and void worlds generate.
- **Chunks:** each player's simulation zone (tick-distance) stays loaded and changed chunks are
  saved at the end of each tick. The view zone (view-distance) is loaded, encoded once, sent in
  BDS's sub-chunk request mode and released. A ticket (`KeepLoaded` on a box, a radius or a list of
  chunks) keeps chunks loaded without a player, ticking or frozen, until it is released.
- **Regions:** loaded chunks belong to regions that tick in parallel at 20 TPS each and merge and
  split as players move (`TickCores` sets how many cores tick). A player who moves far away, such
  as by a teleport, goes straight to the region there instead of merging the two.
- **Block ticks:** random ticks at the level's random tick speed and the two scheduled tick queues,
  loaded from and saved to the chunk, on a world tick kept in level.dat.
- **Players and entities:** players see each other (AddPlayer within BDS's 57-chunk disc,
  `EntityViewRadius2`, changeable while running), MovePlayer for their movement, and the player
  list. Other entities stay in loaded chunks, pass to the region they move into and unload with
  their chunk; where they were is saved when they leave.
- **Abilities:** permission levels, game mode and attributes follow BDS 1.26.60 (layered abilities,
  its per-game-mode rules, its saved format) and are sent at join in BDS's order.
- **Inventory:** items are loaded from and saved in BDS's format. Every inventory change the client
  asks for is checked as BDS checks it (stack network IDs, counts, stack sizes, armour slots and
  offhand items as BDS lists them, creative-only destroy and creative items) before it happens.
- **Registry:** built at boot from BDS 1.26.60's data: 23,960 states of 1,480 blocks with their
  network hashes and BDS's runtime numbers (light, flammability, explosion resistance, friction,
  destroy time), 2,080 items, 89 biomes with BDS's numeric IDs and 138 entity types with their
  definitions, plus the creative inventory and recipes, which can change while running. Joining
  players get the registry packets; untouched, each is byte for byte BDS's.
- **Plugins:** can add, replace and delete any registry entry in `Config.Setup`. World packets go
  through a handler table plugins can replace or wrap, per packet or per system (movement so far),
  on the player's region tick.

- **Breaking and placing (first pass, not yet tested in game):** block breaking the way BDS
  1.26.60 does it with server-authoritative breaking: cracks and BDS's hit, break and place sounds for everyone near, the reach,
  the break speed from the tool, Efficiency, Aqua Affinity, Haste, Conduit Power, Mining Fatigue,
  being in the air or under water, and BDS's resend when the client got it wrong. Placing puts the
  held block item's block where the player clicked (replacing grass, water and the other blocks BDS
  lets you build over), with the place sound, and uses up one item. Tools wear as in BDS
  (Unbreaking included) and break when worn out; effects run out.
  Every step, every enchantment and effect, and the player's own break speed and reach can be
  changed by plugins; `OnBlockBreak` and `OnBlockPlace` events can cancel or change them.

## What is left

- **Vanilla terrain generation** is not hooked up yet, so an infinite world shows only what it has
  saved.
- **Block behaviour:** blocks tick, but no vanilla block has tick behaviour yet. Blocks are
  placed in their item's state: facing, halves and other placement rules are not done, nor is
  clicking blocks that open or toggle (chests, doors, levers).
- **Breaking leftovers:** no drops (no item entities yet), no hunger cost, and only the placing
  player blocks a placement (BDS checks every entity against the placed block's collision boxes).
  Spears and other data-driven items do not wear yet. Stacking petals and leaf litter, and BDS's
  own snow layer rule, are not done.
- **Dropping and crafting** items are not done yet.
- **Everything else** (mobs, combat, redstone, commands, UI) comes after core player gameplay.
  [API_DESIGN.md](https://github.com/helix-bedrock/.github/blob/main/API_DESIGN.md) lists which
  topics are designed.
- **The API is not stable yet.** Names and behaviour may still change between commits.
